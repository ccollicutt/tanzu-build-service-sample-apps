# Tanzu Build Service Sample Apps and Deployments

This is an example of some extremely simple applications being built by the [Tanzu Build Service](https://tanzu.vmware.com/build-service) and deployed into Kubernetes.

## Origins 

nodejs and go apps were originally from [Paketo samples](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/samples).

## Build Apps With Tanzu Build Service

Set the registry location. Of course this assume TBS is all setup, secrets added, etc.

```bash
export REGISTRY=<your registry>
```

### go

Create the TBS image.

```bash
kp image create tbs-sample-go \
--tag $REGISTRY/tbs-sample-go \
--git https://github.com/ccollicutt/tbs-sample-apps/ \
--sub-path sample-apps/go \
--git-revision main
```

### nodejs

Create the TBS image.

```bash
kp image create tbs-sample-nodejs \
--tag $REGISTRY/tbs-sample-nodejs \
--git https://github.com/ccollicutt/tbs-sample-apps/ \
--sub-path sample-apps/nodejs \
--git-revision main
```

### python

#### Setup Builder

As of March, 2021, there isn't a Python builder in TBS (but will be soon) so we use the Paketo community version.

* Add the buildpack to the clusterstore

```bash
kp clusterstore add default -b gcr.io/paketo-community/python
```

* Create a cluster builder

>NOTE: the `python.yaml` buildler file is in the builder folder.

```bash
export REGISTRY=<your TBS registry>
cd builders
kp builder create py-builder \
--tag $REGISTRY/paketo-buildpacks_python \
--order python.yaml \
--stack base \
--store default
```

#### Create Image

* Create the image

>Note the use of the `--cluster-builder` option.

```bash
kp image create tbs-sample-python \
--cluster-builder py-builder \
--tag $REGISTRY/tbs-sample-python \
--git https://github.com/ccollicutt/tbs-sample-apps/ \
--sub-path sample-apps/python \
--git-revision main
```

## Running

You need to:

1. Have built the images via TBS and pushed them to an image registry
1. Have a Kubernetes cluster to deploy to (must be able to access `$REGISTRY`)
2. Create a namespace called `sample-apps`
2. Ensured there is a secret called `regcred` in the `sample-apps` namespace with the correct credentials to access the `$REGISTRY`

### Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ccollicutt/tbs-sample-apps
cd tbs-sample-apps
```

### Set Registry Location

Set this variable to wherever TBS is pushing the built images.

```bash
export REGISTRY=<your registry>
```

### go

```bash
export IMAGE_LOCATION=$REGISTRY/tbs-sample-go
cd k8s/overlays/go
kustomize edit set image tbs-sample-app=$IMAGE_LOCATION
kustomize build | k apply -f-
```

### nodejs

Assuming the image was called `tbs-sample-nodejs`:

```bash
export IMAGE_LOCATION=$REGISTRY/tbs-sample-nodejs
cd k8s/overlays/nodejs
kustomize edit set image tbs-sample-app=$IMAGE_LOCATION
kustomize build | k apply -f-
```


### python

Assuming the image was called `tbs-sample-python`:

```bash
export IMAGE_LOCATION=$REGISTRY/tbs-sample-nodejs
cd k8s/overlays/nodejs
kustomize edit set image tbs-sample-app=$IMAGE_LOCATION
kustomize build | k apply -f-
```
